EXPRESS
	Sinatra inspired web development framework for Node.js -- insanely fast, flexible and simple
	Sinatra is a simple web development framework for Ruby

	Provides things like:
		Easy route URLs to callbacks
		Middleware (from Connect)
		Environment based configuration
		Redirection helpers
		File Uploads

Building our express app
	require the library
		var express = require('express');

	install it using npm
		$ npm install --save express
			the --save adds express to our dependencies in our package.json file

	create an instance of express
		var app = express();

	start defining endpoints
		app.get('/', function(request, response) {
			response.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
		});
			Here we are defining an endpoint at the root route (the '/')
			When somebody sends the get request, it is going to call the callback we are sending in
			We are calling the response.sendfile which will read in a file in our file system and
			send it back with a response

	tell it to listen to port 8080
		app.listen(8080);

	now if we call curl we should get a response from our server
		$ curl http://localhost:8080/
			200 OK
