SOCKET.IO
	Modern browsers have websockets
		Allows for duplex communication
		Can't rely on browsers having this
			SOCKET.IO library exists for this reason
				Abstracts websockets with fallbacks

	Install socket.io
		$ npm install --save socket.io

Running our code
	$ node app.js

	log in to web browser

	We get an alert pop up and we get the log message

Socket io has a broadcast property that will emit the messages to everyone in the chatroom
	socket.broadcast.emit("message", 'Hello');
