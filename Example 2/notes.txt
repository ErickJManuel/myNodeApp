EVENTS
	events in the DOM 

The DOM triggers Events and you can listen for those events
	ie 	click		}
		submit		}	events
		hover		}

Sample Jquery for a click event
	$("p").on("click", function(){   });

The above jquery runs when 'click' event is triggered which essentially
attaches the even to the DOM

Just like the DOM, many objects in NODE emits EVENTS

Odds are if the objects in NODE emit EVENTS they inherit from the EventEmitter constructor

net.Server class inherits from EventEmitter and it emits the  REQUEST event

fs.readStream also inherits from EventEmitter and it emits the DATA event as we are reading data from the file
